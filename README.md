## Duluth Public Works Map

This is a civic data experiment in mapping public works information. Check out [the demo](http://stormy-reaches-6967.herokuapp.com/). 

## Getting started

1. Clone [the repository](http://github.com/tpwebpros/duluth-publicworks-map)
2. Run a local server rooted in the public directory, e.g.

        $ cd public && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9876

3. Browse to `http://localhost:9876`

Change, commit, pull request, and so on :)
